# Wiki Log

## [2026-07-21] ingest | Initial Wiki Build
- Added wiki schema to CLAUDE.md (page format, operations, index/log conventions)
- Created index.md — catalog of all 31 wiki pages by category

## [2026-07-23] implement | TurboQuant KV Cache Compression
- Created `backend/app/engines/shared/turboquant/` package (config, polarquant, qjl, codebook, kv_cache, hf_proxy)
- Added settings: `turboquant_enabled`, `turboquant_bits`, `turboquant_qjl_enabled`, `turboquant_rotation`
- Wired into LayerStream engine via optional `turboquant_config` param on `LayerExecutor`
- Added `KVCacheManager.create(mode="turboquant")` factory to layerstream/kv_cache.py
- Added `use_turboquant` flag to FullRAM `KVCache`
- Added `sovereign benchmark-turboquant` CLI command
- Self-check verifies PolarQuant + QJL reconstruction MSE < 0.02 on unit vectors
- Skipped bit-packing (ponytail) — add when real memory pressure is measured
## [2026-07-24] review | Ponytail Review
- Ran `/ponytail-review` across full codebase
- Found ~3800 lines of unnecessary complexity (dead providers, duplicate task resolvers, 1003-line inference handler with 18 unused task handlers, USB bundle protocol over-engineering, zombie memory manager, etc.)
- Created [[workflow/Ponytail Review|Ponytail Review]] page, updated index
- Created log.md — timeline tracking
- Batch-ingested 31 Docs/ sources into wiki pages with frontmatter, synthesis, and [[wikilinks]]
- Cross-linked related pages: PRD↔TRD, FullRAM↔LayerStream, tech-stack↔Technical Architecture, etc.
## ingest | Literature Review
- Created [[project/Literature Review|Literature Review]] — 6 high-impact papers on edge AI, quantization, attention, speculative decoding, RAG
- Cross-linked to FullRAM, LayerStream, Engine Algorithms
- Updated index, appended to log
## review | Ponytail Audit (full project)
- Scanned all backend (21,813 lines) + frontend (8,303 lines) + root
- Found ~5000 lines removable across USB bundle provider, enterprise repo, ManualStream, inference.py handlers, settings over-engineering, root clutter, singleton pattern, layerstream executor duplication
- Created [[workflow/Ponytail Audit|Ponytail Audit]] page, updated index, appended to log
## doc | Technical Documentation (.docx)
- Created `create_docs.py` — generates a professional `.docx` technical documentation file for SovereignAI Edge
- 12 sections covering executive summary, architecture, dual engines, UI, plugins, RAG, model management, API reference, setup, security, system requirements, project structure
- Styled output with cover page, table of contents, tables, code blocks, color headers
- Drops into `/sessions/.../SovereignAI_Edge_Documentation.docx`
